* Algorithm
** Research
   The algorithm is based on the research [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03235]["Growing Wikipedia Across Languages via Recommendation"]]
** Implementation
*** Wikidata dumps
    Currently, the Wikidata dumps are being generated manually, and the
    latest dumps are from 10/01/2018.
*** Top Wikipedias
    1. We get the list of top 50 Wikipedias (by article count) from Erik
       Zachte's StatisticsMonthly.csv (stat1007). We'll use this list in
       a later step.
*** Page views
    1. For a given Wikipedia, we first calculate the number of page
       views (over the last 180 days ending with a given date) for each
       article (in the Main namespace) that has a Wikidata ID.
    2. For each article we also calculate its normalized rank and its
       log rank. Article's normalized rank is article's rank when it's
       sorted in increasing order of page view counts and divided by the
       total number of articles in Wikipedia for that language. Under
       the hood we use hive's RANK (as opposed to ROW_NUMBER,
       DENSE_RANK, etc.) function. Log rank is the natural logarithm of
       the page's rank.
    3. We also create a dataframe that contains the page view count,
       normalized rank, and log rank for the top 50 Wikipedias.
*** Training
    1. For a given language pair (source â€“ target), we identify common
       Wikidata items that are present in both language Wikipedias.
    2. Each common Wikidata item will have 151 features. In addition to
       the Wikipedia site link count in Wikidata for the item, this
       includes each of the top 50 language's page view count,
       normalized rank, and log rank.
    3. We use these features to train a random forest regressor. The
       output is the normalized rank for each item in the target
       Wikipedia.
*** Predicting
    1. We then find Wikipedia articles that are present in the source
       Wikipedia and absent from the target Wikipedia. For these
       articles using the 151 features and the trained model, we predict
       the normalized ranks.
    2. Predicted normalized ranks range from 1/{article count in
       Wikipedia} (articles that are viewed only once) to 1 (most viewed
       articles).
    3. The higher the normalized rank, the more page views an article is
       predicted to receive if created in the target language.
